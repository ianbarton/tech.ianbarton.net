Like most people I and my family have multiple gadgets that require
recharging at regular intervals. In recent years most gadgets can be
recharged via a micro usb cable. However, not all charger plugs are
equal. Many don't supply sufficient output to recharge things like
iPads and Kindles. So if you want to recharge an iPad something like a
Kindle recharging plug isn't going to work. What I really wanted was a
single device that would recharge any of our gadgets, preferably more
than one at a time.

Browsing Amazon I can across the  [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00EJA28ES/ref%3Doh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie%3DUTF8&psc%3D1][Anker]] 25W 5A 5-Port USB Wall
Charger. This small device has five usb ports that will recharge
almost any gadget that can be charged via micro usb. Two of the ports
output 2.1 amps and will recharge anything including iPads, Nexus 7's
and Kindle Fires. The two 1 amp outputs will recharge most smartphones
and the 1 amp port will also charge many smartphones, albeit at a
slower rate. I have tested this device simultaneously recharging an
iPad, a Nexus 7 and a Samsung Galaxy 2. I can see it being very useful
on holiday, when I only need to remember to take the Anker and five
micro usb cables, which will recharge any of our gadgets. No more
searching around for device specific usb plugs.
