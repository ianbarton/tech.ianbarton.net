My Samsung XE303C12 Chromebook doesn't have 3g. I was wondering how I could
tether my phone and after a bit of research found that if I simply
plugged the phone into a USB port it was recognized as an ethernet
device and I could tether to the phone. So I can now connect to the
internet when there is no WiFi available.
