I have often wondered how cold it got inside and outside my tent
during the night. My Casio Protrek watch has a thermometer. However,
this has a couple of disadvantages. Firstly the sensor is on the side
of the watch, so if you are wearing it on your wrist it just measures
your external body temperature. Secondly, it only shows the current
temperature and not the maximum or minimum.

If you have a greenhouse, you are probably familiar with the "U"
shaped spirit thermometer, which has a metal cylinder on each column
to indicate the min and max temperature. These aren't very practical
to carry around in your rucksack.

Recently I saw a [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Solar-Digital-Window-Thermometer-Greenhouse/dp/B004Z00Z56/ref%3Dsr_1_1?ie%3DUTF8&qid%3D1328887573&sr%3D8-1][Digital Solar Thermometer]] on Amazon. This displays
the current temperature and the minimum and maximum. It's small and
only weighs 15g. You can choose to display the temperature in either
Celsius or Fahrenheit and there is a reset button, which resets the
min and max display. As far as I can tell, the min and max will be
reset after 24hrs automatically. Checking the temperature against
another digital thermometer it seems to be accurate.
