* Indoor Helicopters.
Having three young children is always a useful excuse for buying new
toys. Last week I was looking around our local model shop and the
owner was flying a small twin rotor plastic helicopter around the
shop. Anyway I couldn't resist and ended up buying one.

The model we bought is the same as [[https://shop.graupner.de/webuerp/servlet/AI%3FARTN%3D4483][this]] one. It was surprisingly easy
to learn to fly. You can fly for about 10 minutes with a single charge
of the built in rechargeable battery. The only problem is getting it
away from the children long enough for me to be able to fly it!
