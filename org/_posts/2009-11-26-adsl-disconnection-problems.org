title: ADSL Connection Problems.

excerpt: "Some time ago I upgraded my ADSL to ADSL Max. This worked very well
indeed for quite a long time. However, several months ago I noticed
that my Zyxel 660H D1 router kept disconnecting, sometimes for several
minutes. I have tried all the usual things like disconnecting
everything else on the phone line. My router is already plugged into
BT's master socket, so it isn't dodgy internal wiring and I have tried
a Netgear router which showed the same symptoms. [[%5B%5Bhttp://www.wizards.co.uk][Wizards]] my ISP were
very helpful, but we couldn't really pin down the problem. The next
step would be to get BT to test the line. However, if they can't find
a fault they charge you £169 for the privilege of testing your
line. Given that the fault was intermittent, it's quite likely that
they wouldn't find anything wrong."

* ADSL Disconnection Problems.
Some time ago I upgraded my ADSL to ADSL Max. This worked very well
indeed for quite a long time. However, several months ago I noticed
that my Zyxel 660H D1 router kept disconnecting, sometimes for several
minutes. I have tried all the usual things like disconnecting
everything else on the phone line. My router is already plugged into
BT's master socket, so it isn't dodgy internal wiring and I have tried
a Netgear router which showed the same symptoms. [[%5B%5Bhttp://www.wizards.co.uk][Wizards]] my ISP were
very helpful, but we couldn't really pin down the problem. The next
step would be to get BT to test the line. However, if they can't find
a fault they charge you £169 for the privilege of testing your
line. Given that the fault was intermittent, it's quite likely that
they wouldn't find anything wrong.

Recently I stumbled across an article on [[%5B%5Bhttp://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/22/zen_ar7_infineon_bt_fault/][The Register]] "ISP blows the
whistle on router chip 'fault'", which described a router problem very
similar to mine. In a nutshell many ADSL routers us a Texas
Instruments AR7 chip, which ''may'' be causing the disconnect
problems. BT's engineers use ADSL modems with a different chipset,
which doesn't seem to have this problem, so when they test your line
they can't find any thing wrong.

So I have decided to get another router. Unfortunately, most router
spec. sheets don't tell you what chipset they are using. However, I
have found out that Thompson Speedtouch ADSL modems (as used by BT)
use a different chipset. My problem is I need a fairly specialized
type of router. I have a block of fixed IP addresses from
[[http://www.wizards.co.uk | Wizards]], which I can map to specific
computers on my network. This means that I can then access these
computers from anywhere that there is an Internet connection. In order
for this to be secure these connections need to pass through the
router's firewall. This require a feature called multi NAT, which
isn't standard on most routers. After some research I found the
Thomson SpeedTouch 780WL Wireless ADSL 2/2+ VoIP Router from [[http://www.broadbandbuyer.co.uk/Shop/MFR/ShopDetail.asp%3FProductID%3D3784][Broadband
Buyer]] , which supports multi NAT. It also has several VOIP features,
which means I'll be able to replace my Sipura VOIP box.

You might wonder why I would want to access my computers from the Internet, so here are a few reasons:

- I can program my MythTV box, so when we go out and I have forgotten to record Coronation Street or Dr Who, I can do it via my mobile phone.
- I can make cheap calls anywhere in the world from my mobile using my VOIP account.
- Access to my data from anywhere.
